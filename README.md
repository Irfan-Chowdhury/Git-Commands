### Merging branch via command line:
If you do not want to use the merge button or an automatic merge cannot be performed, you can perform a manual merge on the command line. However, the following steps are not applicable if the base branch is protected.
- Step 1: Clone the repository or update your local repository with the latest changes.
```bash
git pull origin develop
```

- Step 2: Switch to the base branch of the pull request.
```bash
git checkout develop
```

- Step 3: Merge the head branch into the base branch.
```bash
git merge tenant-authorization
```

- Step 4: Push the changes.
```bash
git push -u origin develop
```

### Fetch new branch from remote to local machine:
If a team member has created a new branch on the GitHub server and you want to fetch and work with that branch locally, you can follow these steps:

- Step 1: Fetch Branches from the Remote
```bash
git fetch origin
```

- Step 2: List Remote Branches
```bash
git branch -r
```

- Step 3: Check Out the New Branch
```bash
git checkout -b new-branch-name origin/new-branch-name
```
This command will create a new local branch named branch-name that tracks the remote branch of the same name. It also checks out the new branch so you can start working on it.


- Step 4: Push Changes to the Remote (Optional)
```bash
git push origin new-branch-name
```
<br>

## C. Publish your private assignments in your github public repository

- #### `Check Current URL`
    ```bash
    git remote -v
    ```

<i>Then create a new repository. After get new repository link update something in your locale machine which is in private mode. Copy the new url and jus change <b>set-url</b> instead of <b>add</b></i> 

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Irfan-Chowdhury/your_new_repository.git
```

```bash
git push
```

<br>

## D. Undo last commit from local and remote 

- #### `Locally`
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

- #### `Remotely`
```bash
git push origin +HEAD
```

<br>

## E. Tag
- #### `For Releasing New Version`
```bash
git tag -a v0.1.2 -m "Release v0.1.2"
git push --follow-tags
```

<br>

## F.  Control your specific files/directory to visible/hide in GitHub
- #### `For remove/hide`
```bash
git rm -r --cached app/Http/Controllers
```

- #### `For add/visible`
```bash
git add -f app/Http/Controllers/Landlord
```
- #### `After doing these, please run these commands given below` 
```bash
git commit -m "Control my controller files"
git push origin main
```
<br>

## G. Pushing Issues
If you face authenticate issue during try to push from terminal, first check which remote url exists in your repository. 
- check remote url
```bash
git remote -v
```
- if url start with `https://github.com/` then replace with `git@github.com`. For example, suppose your url is `https://github.com/Irfan-Chowdhury/Git-Commands.git`. Now set with `git@github.com:Irfan-Chowdhury/Git-Commands.git`.
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Irfan-Chowdhury/Git-Commands.git
```
Now you can push easily from your terminal.
